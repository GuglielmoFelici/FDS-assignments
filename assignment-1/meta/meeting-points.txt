1. See the NumPy lectures from ML course.
2. Use this repo.
3. Split functions in groups of 3, discuss the solution together for each function, and then implement one function each on our own. Finally, check the results together.
4. We have roughly 22 days, which means each block of 3 functions should take MAX 2 days.
5. I suggest daily meetings.
